# Versions Histories And Social Values

## Computational Approaches to Studying Social Coding in DH

Potential questions:

- How is Github transforming DH coding work?
- Who is doing this coding work?
  - Contributors to the project vs the project citation itself
- Types of commits? 
  - Emerging norms for coding work? Are people using this as robust collaboration platform or just archiving materials?
  - How much collaboration is really going?
- Project Management on Github? Project maintainers?
- Which repos become more collaborative or archival? Which ones are being starred or forked more frequently?
- reach out to certain people in the community for oral history for their git history?
