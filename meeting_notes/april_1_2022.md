1. Decided to separate questions into individual notebooks.
   - Data Gathering
   - Individual Questions
2. Worked on framing hypotheses for the paper.

Potential questions:

- How is Github transforming DH coding work?
- Who is doing this coding work?
  - Contributors to the project vs the project citation itself
- Types of commits?
  - Emerging norms for coding work? Are people using this as robust collaboration platform or just archiving materials?
  - How much collaboration is really going?
- Project Management on Github? Project maintainers?
- Which repos become more collaborative or archival? Which ones are being starred or forked more frequently?
- reach out to certain people in the community for oral history for their git history?

Next Steps:

- Zoe keep working on the data gathering for repos
- Jeri start data gathering for contributors and collaborators
- Keep working on creating the secondary lit review
- Jeri will email Ian Milligan to make sure we are a good fit for the special issue
